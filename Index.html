  <h1>World video gaming championship</h1> \
<p>The **Minecraft Championship (MCC)** is a competitive event where ten teams of four players each compete in a series of
custom-designed mini-games that test various Minecraft skills, including parkour, survival, combat, and teamwork. After
eight games, the two teams with the highest scores face off in a final showdown called "Dodgebolt" to determine the
ultimate champion. citeturn0search8

Organized by Noxcrew and Scottish YouTuber Scott Major (also known as Smajor1995 or Dangthatsalongname), MCC was first
held on November 17, 2019. The tournament has continued to evolve, introducing new maps, designs, and participants over
time. As of December 8, 2024, MCC has completed its fourth season. citeturn0search6

In addition to the main events, MCC has hosted special non-canon tournaments, such as a Pride-themed event in June 2021
that raised funds for The Trevor Project. Other variations include MCC Rising, featuring less established Minecraft
content creators, and MCC All-Stars, showcasing past MCC winners. citeturn0search6

To engage the broader Minecraft community, Noxcrew launched **MCC Island**, a public Minecraft server featuring
mini-games inspired by those in MCC. Announced on May 30, 2021, the server entered closed beta on August 20, 2022, and
opened to the public on June 20, 2023. citeturn0search6

MCC continues to be a significant event in the Minecraft community, bringing together popular content creators and fans
for regular competitions that celebrate the game's diverse gameplay and foster a sense of community.</p>
