<h1>Spiderman biography</h1>
<p>Summary:
Spider-Man: Homecoming is the first solo film of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), following his
introduction in Captain America: Civil War (2016). This movie marks a new chapter for the character, with Tom Holland
stepping into the role of Peter Parker, a high school student trying to balance life as a teenager and as a superhero.

In this film, Peter Parker is mentored by Tony Stark (Iron Man) but is eager to prove himself as a hero on his own
terms. The movie’s villain is Adrian Toomes, aka Vulture (played by Michael Keaton), a former salvage worker who turns
to crime after a government contract takes away his livelihood. He uses advanced alien technology from the Battle of New
York (as seen in The Avengers) to create deadly weapons and wreak havoc.

The film highlights Peter's struggles with his identity, as he deals with the pressure of living up to the expectations
of Tony Stark while trying to be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The youthful, grounded tone of the film captures
the character’s high school life, and his attempt to prove himself as a capable hero in the larger MCU world.</p>
